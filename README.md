# scuffed_vehicle_detection
Vehicle detection with HOG from scratch, a SVM and heat maps

## Requirements
You can install the dependencies by:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## About
This repository contains a HOG implementation from scratch, trained with the
GTI training set (https://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/~jal/download.html) for vehicle detection.

To launch the training pipeline, run the `test.sh` script.

To find out how to use the generated classifier (will be generated at `car_classifier.pkl`),
view the `test.py` script.

Testing accuracy metrics are also generated by `test.py`. I did not make an attempt to split
the original dataset in a training set and testing set every time -- instead, I used some
random (often challenging) images from the web for testing.
